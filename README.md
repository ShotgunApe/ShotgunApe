<h2 align="center"> Hello! My name is Will. </h2>

### About Me
- I'm a CS graduate based in Cincinnati, OH.
- For my Senior thesis, I studied [artificial reverberation](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Artificial_Reverberation.html) by comparing Schroeder Reverberators to real acoustic spaces.
- In my free time, I enjoy producing music and playing rhythm games such as BMS.
