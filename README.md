<h2 align="center"> Hello! My name is Will. </h2>

### About Me
- I'm a CS graduate based in Cincinnati, OH.
- For my Senior thesis, I studied [artificial reverberation](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Artificial_Reverberation.html) by comparing Schroeder Reverberators to real acoustic spaces.
- In my free time, I enjoy [producing](https://soundcloud.com/fjwaslkd) [music](https://soundcloud.com/fjwiplkd) and playing rhythm games such as BMS.

### Things I've Done
- I love audio development, and have previously made a basic [synthesizer plugin](https://github.com/ShotgunApe/VST-Synth) in C++.
- I have [mined software repositories](https://github.com/ShotgunApe/Seco-Pages) and explored how they change with time.
- I am working on a [personal website](https://fhw.moe/) in an attempt to remove social media from my life.
